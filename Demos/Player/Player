  This is a demo for the player API

  The player API has following functions:
    - player.spawn(pathToSprite, x, y)
    - player.setPos(x, y)
    - player.control(UpKey, LeftKey, DownKey, RightKey, AllowUp, AllowLeft, AllowDown, AllowRight)
    - player.Movement()
    - player.kill()
    - player.heal(points)
    - player.setHealth(points)
    - player.damage(points)

    The "Allow..." in "player.control" are booleans which allow the player to move up/down/left/right
    "player.Movement()" handles the Players Movement

    The Player API Also has a table where you can access and edit the Player:
      - player.CurrentPlayer["Sprite"]
      - player.CurrentPlayer["Health"]
      - player.CurrentPlayer["XPos"]
      - player.CurrentPlayer["YPos"]
